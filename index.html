    <h2>25% Of Asian Americans In NYC Fell Into Poverty During the Pandemic</h2>
    <h4>But far fewer of them took advantage of social services.</h4>
<div id="mydataviz"></div>
<p>About one in four Asian adults in New York City lived in poverty in 2020, according to a <a href="https://www.robinhood.org/annual-poverty-tracker-report-aapi-poverty/#:~:text=Robin%20Hood's%20targeted%20research%20found,rate%20for%20white%20New%20Yorkers.">report released by Robin Hood</a>, a poverty-fighting non-profit, in collaboration with Columbia University. Yet when we look at data collected through <a href="https://equity.nyc.gov/"> Equity NYC</a>, the percentage of Asians who took advantage of the city's social safety nets fell far below that. The reasons for this gap vary, but researchers point to: the lack of non-English outreach within these communities, a general distrust of the government, and community stigma around needing "a handout."</p>
